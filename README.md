- 👋 Hi, I’m @Syridian
- 👀 I’m interested in electronics, art, 3D sculpting, and the world around us.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning lots of little things that may or may not evolve into bigger projects 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything that you think I might be helpful in, until we both work out that it wasn't the best fit and go our seperate ways. 
- 📫 How not to reach me ...
